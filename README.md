# Movie Watchlist

This project is part of the challenges in the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/). It’s another practical way I’ve been improving my frontend skills while building something useful and fun.

## About the Project

The Movie Watchlist is a JavaScript-based web app that allows users to search for movies and add them to a personalized watchlist. This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, working with APIs, and improving the user experience with dynamic updates.

### Features:
- Fetching movie data from a public API
- Adding and removing movies from a watchlist
- Storing the watchlist in local storage to persist between sessions

## What I Learned

This project helped me:
- **Work with APIs**: Fetching and displaying movie data taught me how to interact with external APIs and handle responses.
- **Use local storage**: Managing persistent data locally gave me insight into client-side storage options.
- **Improve DOM manipulation skills**: Updating the UI dynamically based on user actions was a key part of this project.

## Scrimba Career Path Challenges

The Scrimba course continues to provide projects that encourage experimentation and hands-on learning. The Movie Watchlist was a great way to apply JavaScript fundamentals in a meaningful way.

### Other Takeaways from the Course
- Better understanding of asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, promises).
- Improved ability to break down problems into smaller, solvable tasks.
- More confidence in debugging and testing small apps.
